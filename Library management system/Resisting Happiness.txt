Introduction
The right book at the right time can be life changing. Resisting Happiness is that book.
We all know the things that will make us happy, but we don’t always do them. Why? We’re
resistant. With his signature combination of the profound and the practical, New York Times
bestselling author Matthew Kelly helps you learn why we sabotage ourselves, feel overwhelmed, set aside our dreams, and lack the courage to simply be ourselves . . . and how to
start choosing happiness again. Resisting Happiness will inspire you to break through resistance
so you can become the-best-version-of-yourself and start living with passion and purpose.
This study guide is designed to accompany Dynamic Catholic’s 2017 Best Lent Ever
program. Daily videos from Matthew Kelly and Dynamic Catholic team members provide
incredible insights and personal reflections on the chapters of Resisting Happiness that
will enhance your group’s experience with the book. You and your group can sign up at
DynamicCatholic.com/LentSignUp to get emails sent straight to your inboxes every day
during Lent.
We hope you enjoy Resisting Happiness, and we pray this study guide is a useful resource for
your Lenten journey.
May God bless you and bring you closer to him each day this Lent,
The Dynamic Catholic Team

Study Guide Purpose and Format
The purpose of this study guide is to help readers dive deeper into Resisting Happiness by
applying the topics of the book to their everyday lives, specifically in light of the Lenten
season. While it has been created primarily for use in small faith groups and book clubs, it
can also be used by individuals for personal reflections.
You can request a free copy of Resisting Happiness (just pay shipping) at
DynamicCatholic.com/GetHappy, or visit DynamicCatholic.com/ShareHappiness to
buy books for your whole group at at a discounted price (quantities of 6 or more).
The study guide consists of six sessions. We recommend these sessions take place once a
week. Depending on the day your group meets, you can start on or after Ash Wednesday,
or you can start the first full week of Lent.
Each session follows the same format:
Opening Prayer
Watch Video(s)
Discussion Questions
Closing Prayer
Announcements
We recommend that a group meets for 60–90 minutes and agrees on a fixed length of time.
If your group does not get through all the questions during that time, that is okay. Spend
the time on the questions that are most relevant to your group.
It is assumed that participants will have completed the reading assignment before
attending each session. We recommend that participants also sign up for Best Lent Ever at
DynamicCatholic.com/LentSignUp so they can watch the daily videos throughout Lent.
This will help them stay more engaged and will better prepare them for group discussion.
Note: Depending on the day you meet, different videos will be available. You can
select the appropriate video from the selection depending on your group’s schedule.
A new video will be posted each day (Monday through Saturday) during Lent. You
can access the videos at DynamicCatholic.com/Videos starting March 1, or visit
DynamicCatholic.com/LentSignUp to sign up to receive them in your inbox daily.

and wisdom to live all the good things
we explore here together.
Send your Spirit upon us so that we can discover your dream

in every moment of our days.

Discussion Questions
1. What is one way that you have encountered resistance?
2. Are you as happy as you could be? In chapter two of Resisting Happiness, the author asks
us to give ourselves a happiness score between 1 and 10 over the past three months. What
score would you give yourself?
3. Lent is a great time to take a step back and look at our lives. In what area of your life do
you need to place God at the center?
4. Have you ever wanted something good for someone more than they wanted it for themselves?
5. What hard battle are you fighting?
6. In chapter five, the author says we are called to put ourselves in the middle of the mess
of the world and work to make a difference, however small. What does that mean to you in
light of the Lenten call to prayer, fasting, and almsgiving?
7. Has restlessness ever pushed you to become a-better-version-of-yourself?
